In the following documents the Emergency mode threshold is listed as 17.5 volts: Glory Performance Specification (requirement 8.3.3), GDRD (requirements 4.1.24, 4.1.25), DN-ProjectC-SYS-034 (section 2.1 EPS), EPS.ppt (p 23) The main concern lies within the requirements documents (and the design note documents referenced directly within SRS requirements documents). Specifically, the Performance Specification document, and DN-ProjectC-SYS-014 (Safehold mode). Within the Performance Specification document section 12.2 contains a figure that indicates that the threshold to enter Emergency is 17 volts and to exit is 27 Volts. This figure is contained in many of the other design note documents and the CDR Day 1 powerpoint document. Later in the Performance Specification document is a requirement that specifies that Emergency mode has an entry threshold of 17.5 volts. Currently the main design note document that is of higher concern is DN-ProjectC-SYS-014. This document is specified in both the PIP and ADACS SRS requirements documents. In addition to the figure mentioned above, it includes several places where 17 V is specified as the Emergency Mode entry threshold.
