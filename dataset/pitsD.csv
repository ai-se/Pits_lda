ProjectD - TIM - 1180,Coding Error in EMC,2,"IV&V participated in an EMC Code Review at Contractor2 on January 31, 2007. During the review, IV&V noted that code was contained within an ‰ÛÏif‰Û statement and would only be executed during that logical branch, even though the code was intended to be executed in the more general case outside of the ‰ÛÏif‰Û statement. The error was discovered when comparing the code presented to the design documentation also provided.",4/27/07
ProjectD - TIM - 1182,Possible Inconsistenct in WheelControl RWA selection,3,"In wheel_control.cpp at lines 300-322, the value of locGoodWheelSum (number of ""good"" RWAs) is determined based on the contents of array WheelStatusBad. At lines 349-367, if locGoodWheelSum is 3 (i.e., one wheel is ""not good"") the ""wheels to be used"" (locTorqSelect) are determined based upon the contents of array UseWheel. WheelStatusBad (at this point) appears to reflect the contents of UseWheel (i.e., wheel selected and available) as well as any ""bad wheel data"" indicators received (when so enabled). Thus, if a wheel is selected, available, but has a ""bad data"" indication (and ""detection"" enabled), it will apparently be ""OK"" in UseWheel but ""not OK"" in WheelStatusBad. In such a case, the locGoodWheelSum==3 logic in lines 349-366 will execute, but apparently do nothing (i.e., the torque distribution matrix, etc., will remain at the setting for ""4 good wheels""). It would seem that a wheel with ""bad data"" should probably not received control commands, or, alternately, that the count of wheels to be used for control commanding be computed using the actual term used to differentiate between wheels to be used for control commanding and wheels not so used.",5/17/07
ProjectD - TIM - 1181,Inconsistent Response to Persistent Coarse-to-Fine Pointing Transition Error,3,"In attitude_error.cpp, within method Compute at lines 453-460, term MyGo2AcqSun appears to be set unconditionally if respond2CoarseAttFault is set. In attitude_error.cpp within method Compute at lines 756-761, term MyGo2AcqSun appears to be set when respond2CoarseAttFault is set only if term CoarseAttErrRespEnab (in the Tbl structure for class AttitudeError) is set (and when the vehicle is in ADCS_POINT state). Term respond2CoarseAttFault appears to be set true only in logic in Compute which executes prior to the logic which set MyGo2AcqSun (at line 290 of attitude_error.cpp). Term CoarseAttErrRespEnab in the Tbl structure appears to be used only at the point cited above. It appears that the intent is for CoarseAttErrRespEnab to allow the ground (etc.) to disable ""automatic"" reversion to ACQUIRE_SUN when an excessive amount of time is required to transition from coarse pointing to fine pointing due to persistent inability to meet the initial pointing accuracy limit. If so, the logic does not appear to operate as intended. The logic at lines 453-460 would appear to trigger this reversion regardless of the value of CoarseAttErrRespEnab, and the subsequent logic at lines 756-761 is meaningless (with respect to respond2CoarseAttFault). Even if this supposition is incorrect, it appears that CoarseAttErrRespEnab has essentially no function (the code effectively works the same no matter how it is set). Thus, if the code is correct, the term should presumably be removed or commented out.",5/16/07
ProjectD - TIM - 1176,Possible Unset Data in FFI Status Packet,3,"The output status packet for the FFI Manager (pktdef_ffim_out_status) appears to contain locations for dataSetTimestampSecStart and dataSetTimestampFractionStart, but there appears to be no provision to store any values into these variables. If the ground or some other user of FFI Manager status data expects to find meaningful values there, this would be a problem.",1/22/07
ProjectD - TIM - 1175,Initialization of myCadenceDetected in ffiManager,3,"In FFI manager, it appears that the value of myCadenceDetected is set or altered only in method isrPixelDataReady (to true upon receipt of a long cadence interrupt while ffi processing is active) and in method scienceDataHandler (to false during actual processing of FFI data). It would appear that it would be appropriate to initialize this term (presumably to false), either in the constructor or (perhaps preferably) the Initialize method, as it appears to be within the realm of possibility that its user (method scienceDataHandler) could be entered prior to receiving the first FFI ‰ÛÏlong‰Û cadence interrupt, leaving it to use a value which has not been formally initialized.",1/22/07
ProjectD - TIM - 1174,"Missing default case in function TelemetryManager::ProcessCommand - file tlm.cpp, line 773",3,"This function has a large switch statement that lacks a default. The field being evaluated is a 16 bit unsigned integer as opposed to an enumeral, which means the compiler is unable to evaluate the range of the discrete variable being evaluated. In cases like this it is valuable to provide a default case to catch out-of-range values. The logic depends on each case being handled by the switch statement. The code also violates violates 10.3 (Switch Statements) of the ProjectD FSW Coding Standard (ProjectD.DFM.FSW.087 7/22/02).",1/22/07

The value of locCol at this point appears to have been set at line 739 reflecting the column obtained for the ‰ÛÏtarget center‰Û from the target file. It appears that the intent of the logic between lines 924 and 1002 is to sum (‰ÛÏbin‰Û) the pixel values across all ‰ÛÏmasked rows‰Û for each column in which an aperture pixel for the target exists. It would appear that the existing logic will always give the ‰ÛÏbinned‰Û value for the column of the ‰ÛÏtarget center‰Û, and that the intent would be satisfied by instead using the pixels in locColumn in the call to pixelGet. A similar comment applies to the pixelGet invocation at lines 1028-1023 of scManagerScience.cpp (for ‰ÛÏsmear rows‰Û).",1/22/07
ProjectD - TIM - 1172,Improvements to FPADM Verify Logic,3,"There appear to be two additional checks that could be added to the verifyTargetTable method in lcManagerScience to protect against and/or identify table anomalies / corruptions: - if the ‰ÛÏnumber of targets‰Û value for a given module/output (extracted from the module/output header record into locNumTargets) was excessive, it appears to be possible for the ‰ÛÏmiddle loop‰Û in this method (and in method processTargetTable) to run off the end of the table (i.e., for pTargetTable to reach or exceed locEndAddress) and there does not appear to be any protection against this possible occurrence (note that pTargetTable is checked against locEndAddress in the outer loop, but not in the middle loop) - if the particular aperture referenced for a given target (extracted term locAperture in the middle loop) was never defined in the associated aperture file, its extracted pixel count (term locNumApPixels) should be zero (note that processTableApertureBgCmd and processTableApertureSciCmd in fpaDataManager both zero out their pointer tables before populating them). It would appear that no ‰ÛÏlegitimately used‰Û aperture should contain zero pixels. Although use of a zero pixel aperture would not cause internal software anomalies such as running off the ends of tables, it would appear worthwhile to in some way report that this is occurring, as it would presumably indicate the presence of corrupt or inconsistent target / aperture files. Analogous comments would appear to apply to the short cadence logic.",1/22/07
ProjectD - TIM - 1171,Possible FPADM Inconsistencies Due to Phasing,3,"Long cadence science processing appears to be enabled by receipt of a Science Mode command which requests a transition from IDLE mode to LC or LC_SC mode. When this occurs, it appears that lcManager.cpp method scienceProcessingEnable will permit long cadence science data processing on the next subsequent long cadence termination but not before (sets processingEnabled true and myCadenceBoundaryDetected false), and initializes the terms used to determine the momentum-dump and fine-point indicators for the configId returned with the next long cadence science data (myFinePoint and myMomentumDump) to the last reported statuses from ADCS. Any drop out of fine point or initiation of momentum dump subsequent to receipt of the Science Mode command and prior to cadence end should be reflected in the indicators via method processStatusSystemCmd. It does not appear that the Science Mode command precipitates any hardware commands in FPA Data Manager, and it appears that all cadence interrupts will occur without direct effect from this command. Thus, it would appear possible (at least within the purview of FPA Data Manager) that a Science Mode command initiating long cadence processing could occur at any point during a long cadence (i.e., at any point between two long cadence interrupts), and that the initial long cadence whose science data is processed following such initiation of long cadence science processing will, in general, involve some photometer data gathered before long cadence science processing was in effect in lcManager (i.e., before receipt of the Science Mode command). If fine point had not been in effect and/or momentum dump had been in effect at the beginning of that initial long cadence, but fine point had been entered and momentum dump completed prior to receipt of the ‰ÛÏenabling‰Û Science Mode command, then the reported configId would apparently not contain flags indicating the ‰ÛÏmomentum dump‰Û warning or the ‰ÛÏout of fine point‰Û warning, even though some of the data had been gathered when those ‰ÛÏwarning‰Û conditions had been in effect. For long cadences after the initial following ‰ÛÏscience data processing enable‰Û, the logic seems to be carefully designed so that a momentum dump or out of fine point status at any point during the long cadence results in the setting of the associated ‰ÛÏwarning‰Û bits in the configId. Thus, the effective definition of these ‰ÛÏwarning‰Û bits appears to differ on such an ‰ÛÏinitial‰Û long cadence and subsequent long cadences. Analogous comments would appear to apply to the short cadence logic, and perhaps FFI manager as well. In addition, it would appear that short cadence processing would initiate at the same time as long cadence processing if the new science mode is LC_SC. If, as supposed above, this could occur at any time during the hardware long cadence, then any number of short cadences (up to, of course, the number of short cadences in a long cadence) could be processed by the short cadence manager before the processing of the first long cadence by the long cadence manager. Thus, the short cadence manager‰Ûªs cadenceCount counter-term, at each long cadence termination point, would be (ai + (nl-1) * nsl), where nl is the number of long cadence completions since entering LC_SC science mode, nsl is the number of short cadences per long cadence, and ai (representing cadenceCount at the time of the first long cadence end since entering LC_SC) could be any number between 0 and nsl. The logic in the scienceDataHandler method of scManagerScience appears to clear mypPreviousDataSet whenever cadenceCount reaches an integer multiple of nsl, and to process a baseline whenever cadenceCount reaches an integer multiple of nsl * nb (where nb is the long cadence baseline interval). The intent here appears to phase the clearing of mypPreviousDataSet with the clearing of SDA/SFDA accumulators upon a long cadence and to phase the short cadence baseline with the long cadence baseline. However, it appears that this would only actually occur as intended if ai were either 0 or nl, neither of which appears to be guaranteed by looking at the logic strictly within the purview of FPA Data Manager. We are aware that the appropriate command sequences, which we do not have, might make it impossible for a momentum dump or out-of-fine-point condition to exist during the pre-moding part of such an ‰ÛÏinitial‰Û long cadence, or for short cadence processing to initiate in the ‰ÛÏmiddle‰Û of a hardware long cadence; but based on what we have, it appears to be possible. It may also be the case that the ground always treats such an ‰ÛÏinitial‰Û long cadence as suspect, making the dump/finepoint warning bits moot in such a case. However, barring some such relevant fact of which we are unaware, there appear to be inconsistencies here.",1/22/07

This seems reasonable. However, in addition, the last valid science data packet, whose pointer was just sent to (presumably) the SSR, has all of its data cleared (see lines 537-549 of data_encoder.cpp).

Some examples: (16-bit case) if myCurrent16BitWord is 20, then myCurrent32BitWord is set to 10, and locSourceDataLength is set to 40 bytes, which covers the c-index values 0 through 19 in mypPacket16BitData (32-bit case with myBitPosition == 32) if myCurrent16BitWord is 15, then locSourceDataLength is set to 60 bytes, which covers the c-index values 0 through 14 in mypPacket32BitData (32-bit case with myBitPosition != 32) if myCurrent32BitWord is 15, then myCurrent32BitWord is incremented by 1 to 16, and locSourceDataLength is set to 64 bytes, which covers the c-index values 0 through 15 in mypPacket32BitData This logic appears to match well with the logic in method encode, and works for data loaded by put16 or put32 if the science data is output via an external call to pushPacketAndPrepareNext (e.g., by calling cadenceComplete). However, if the science data is output by put16 or put32 internally calling pushPacketAndPrepareNext due to filling of the science data buffer, the value of myCurrent16BitWord or myCurrent32BitWord (whichever is applicable) appears to represent at that point the C-index of the last used element in array mypPacket16BitData or array mypPacket32BitData (whichever is applicable), since the value of myCurrent16BitWord or myCurrent32BitWord is not incremented between the storage of the last data element and the calling of pushPacketAndPrepareNext.
