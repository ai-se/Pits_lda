The other flNm (third argument of the sprintf statement) is declared on line 63 of qcp.r3.2.1/src/sharmem.h and is of size 50. It is 3 indexes larger presumably to contain a 3 character filename extension. However, there is an ADDITIONAL character that may not have been considered -- the '.' character. If there is a filename of the maximum size of 47 the flNm of size 50 (the third argument to the sprintf statement) may use index values 0..50 (whereas the only legal values are 0.49). Similar issues may cause the flNm of size 47 (shmPtr->sFlsPkt[vcIdx][idx].flNm) to use indexes 0..47 where 47 is not legal. The allowed possibility of the accessing of memory one index beyond the end of the arrays may be the result of not taking into account the '.' character taking up 1 space in addition to the three character filename extension. An additional issue is that no room is made for the trailing null character. In the event this filename extension is to ever be used with a function such as printf this could be another issue also.

There does not appear to be any type of acceptance testing of just the Flight Software before it is integrated with the ground or data processing software according to the information contained in the test plans. However, the latest schedule that was delivered to us, dated 3/15/2006, lists a Flight Software Acceptance Test between Pre-Release G and Flight Software Release #1. So there is a ""planned activity"" labeled ""Flight Software Acceptance Test"" that is not documented in any test plan. This schedule also does not list any type of Software Acceptance Test after the integration of the Flight, Ground and Data Processing software.

Even though the test procedure precedes the test scenario by three months, the procedure was still considered the current version at the time IV&V tried to close the TIMs. While reviewing the test procedure, IV&V noted the following issues: 1.) The Requirements Tested section only lists one requirement -- 1313. However, 23 requirements are defined as local variables. 2.) The Procedures Called section lists four procedures. However, there are as many as four other procedures that are probably called: ut_tlmupdate, ut_loadtable, ut_vec_transform, and ut_cleansys. 3.) The RWA verification test matrix (rvtm_rwa_build1.xls) allocates requirement 2270 to acea_acs_brw_process.prc; however, this requirement is not found in the test procedure. 4.) Rvtm_rwa_build1.xls allocates requirement 2271.3.1 to this test procedure; however, this requirement is not specifically cited in this test procedure. Nonetheless, it appears part of the requirement is verified in step 6. Step 6 has IF statements that check for fewer than 3 RWs being powered on, and FDC is notified. But part b of requirement 2271.3.1 does not appear to be verified. (Reqt 2271.3.1: ""If fewer than three RWs are powered on, the ACS FSW shall a. notify FDC (if enabled) b. make available for downlink knowledge of the anomaly."") 5.) Of the 23 local variables defined for requirements, two are not found in the steps -- reqt_2271g_pass and reqt_4430_pass. 6.) Of the 23 local variables defined for requirements, only 10 have a pass/fail status called (i.e., ut_pfindicate): 2271, 2272, 2272.1.1, 4150, 4151, 4152, 4154, 4431, 4431.1, and 4431.5. 7.) At the end of step 2, a pass/fail indication is assigned to reqt 2271 based on an IF condition that checks only three of the seven components of reqt 2271. The IF condition checks 2271a, 2271b, and 2271c, but does not check 2271d, 2271e, 2271f, and 2271g, all of which appear in subsequent steps. Also requirements 2271a and 2271c are also evaluated later in step 6, yet the pass/fail status for reqt 2271 has already been set in step 2. 8.)

The PROC dated 8-30-05 states that Step 3 tests both 5331.1 and 5334, but that it also tests 5310, 5311, 5412.1 and 5311.2. Why is there such a difference between the scenario document and the PROC? Furthermore the RVTM dated 3-24-05 does not associate some of these requirements with this PROC (e.g., 5310 & 5311). The most recent RVTM dated 5-13-05 lists the same requirements as the previous RVTM, except it added Requirement 5321.

Step 7 ""Source Control"" is missing a part to test Requirement 5331.2 when Ground is in control and ACS sends a move antenna command.

In looking at PROC gcea_bgi_antenna_stop.prc (dated 8-30-05) and analyzing the instructions for Step 7, parts 1 -3 (formerly Step 8 due to mis-numbering), it appears that Step 7 - Part 1 puts ACS in control and then Step 7, Part 2, sends a move command from the Ground which should be rejected since ACS is in control now (per Requirement 5331.2). Step 7, Part 3, puts the ground back in control (as control source). Per closure comments in closed ProjectB-TIM-1993, the PROC is still incomplete as there is no test of an ACS move command while the ground is control. However, this is noted by the tester as a comment in the PROC that the ACS commands will not be ready until Build 2. When Build 2 is ready and to fully satisfy requirement 5331.2, IV&V would expect this PROC to have a new part to Step 7, called ""Part 4"", where the ACS FSW sends a move command when Ground is in control and the expected result should be that the command is rejected if Ground in control and ACS sends the command.",11/14/05ProjectB - TIM - 2209,GCE_BGI Test: PROC gcea_bgi_antenna_move_init.prc dated 7-20-05 still appears fairly incomplete.,3,"PROC gcea_bgi_antenna_move_init.prc dated 7-20-05 still appears fairly incomplete.

IV&V's issue is that the verification description for step 1.8 is lacking information to explicitly define exactly what should be checked and verified in this step. Essentially the verfication description is vague, and should indicate explicit information and data to check for in order to verify this step. Note: In the ""Relationships"" link for TIM-2162, the Results document and Log files of the test can be found. See UART Log File: 2005-07-18-SUROMResetTest-201.log",8/8/05ProjectB - TIM - 2166,"It is unclear why the UART result log shows that the starting address is the same after a POR Rest and a ""Non"" POR Reset when the governing requirements for the conditions indicate otherwise",3,"In step 1.3 a POR Reset is performed. Requirement 1002 which governs a POR Reset essentially states that an image of the SUROM software will be copied into RAM and the software will jump to the ""start"" [address] of the newly loaded image in RAM. 464-FSW-SPEC-0117 Requirement 1002 states: ""If the reset type is Power-On Reset, then the SUROM FSW shall copy the PROM based boot loader image from the PROM chip on the BMC into RAM and jump to the start of the newly loaded image in RAM."" In step 1.7 a ""Not a Power-On Reset"" (Internal Hardware Reset) is performed. Requirement 1003 which governs a ""Non POR Reset"" (Not a Power-On Reset), essentially states that the FSW shall jump to the start [address] of the EEPROM to begin there. 464-FSW-SPEC-0117 Requirement 1003 states: ""If the reset type is NOT a Power-On Reset, then the SUROM FSW shall jump to the start of EEPROM to start the default FSW image stored there."" Upon examining the results of the log file (uart output) for both these test steps (step 1.3 / Req. 1002 and step 1.7 / Req. 1003), it appears that software execution begins at the same starting address location - 0xfff05a70, which contradicts the functionality described in the respective requirements. It may be a lack of understanding on IV&V's part, but based upon the requirement statements governing the POR Reset (1002) and a Non-POR Reset (1003), the starting addresses should be different since after a POR Reset, software execution should start at the address of the new loaded image in RAM. And for a Non-POR Reset, software execution should start at the address of the image stored in the EEPROM. After the two types of reset are performed, it is unclear to IV&V why the two jump to the same starting address Note: In the ""Relationships"" link for TIM-2162, the Results document and Log files of the test can be found.

But in this instance, it is not and therefore it is difficult to determine if the results of this test step are correct or not, since there is a difference in the verification description and the results in the uart log file.

The log file indicates that a POR Reset was detected, however the log file text also indicates that the ""RAM contents [were] preserved"". This is contrary to the functionality described in Requirement 1002, which essentially states that PROM image will be copied into RAM. Therefore, it is unclear to IV&V why the log file states that RAM was preserved. 464-FSW-SPEC-0117 Requirement 1002 states: ""If the reset type is Power-On Reset, then the SUROM FSW shall copy the PROM based boot loader image from the PROM chip on the BMC into RAM and jump to the start of the newly loaded image in RAM.""

IV&V recommends, if possible, including some indication in the test scenario as to the amount of data (i.e number) needing to be checked. For example, for all ACS statistics, how many are there? 10 or 100? It would be good to have an idea so that the tester is aware of ballpark figures that need to be checked.

Note: This is actually realized by the C&DH FSW. IV&V would like to question the completeness of the requirement based on the information contained in the Cold Restart requirements. Requirement 2111 has two sub requirements associated with it. Requirement 2111 states: On cold restart, the FSW shall initialize all ACS data segments, causing all variables to be zeroed or reset to their preset values stored in EEPROM. Requirement 2111.1 states: The FSW shall reset all ACS database-specifiable parameters to their preset values stored in EEPROM. Requirement 2111.2 states: The FSW shall set all ACS telemetry and command output packet buffers to zero. IV&V's question is this: since the Cold Restart has two subrequirements pointing out specific reactions for the database parameters and the telemetry and command output packet buffers, why aren't these specific areas also pointed out as Warm Restart issues as well?

IV&V believes the test scenario is accurate in testing both a Cold Restart and Power On. However, there is no explicit requirement stating that for the ACS FSW, the Power On has the same functionality as a Cold Restart. A Power On is not even listed in the ACS FSS requirements (except in the notes).
