## Different leanrning approaches:

### So for Unstable learning algorithms
- decision tree learning (DT) - supervised and unstable learning method, susceptible to noise.
- neural networks (NN) - supervised, and unstable learning approach
- Bayesian learning (BL), Similar to bayesian, we have got Bayes optimal classifier, naives bayes classifier, Gibbs, and EM. Probabilistic approach. Possibly unstable.
Clustering - LDA

### So for Stable learning algorithms
- concept learning (CL) -  conjunctions of attributes constrains. A supervised learning, not robust to noise.
- reinforcement learning (RL)
- genetic algorithms (GA) and genetic programming (GP)
- instance-based learning (IBL, of which case-based reasoning, or CBR, is a popular method) - K nearest neighbors, locally weighted regression
- inductive logic programming (ILP) - background knowledge during learning process. Eg - SCA, FOIL, Progol, inverted resolution.
- analytical learning (AL, of which explanation-based learning, or EBL is a method)
- combined inductive and analytical learning (IAL) - IAL usually encompasses an inductive (loads of training data) learning component and an analytical (domain knowledge) learning component. Eg - NN+EBL
- ensemble learning (EL).
- stochastic (statistical) learning.
