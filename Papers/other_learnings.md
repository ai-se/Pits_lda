Organize major types of supervised and reinforcement learning methods into the following groups: concept learning (CL), decision tree learning (DT), neural networks (NN), Bayesian learning (BL), reinforcement learning (RL), genetic algorithms (GA) and genetic programming (GP), instance-based learning (IBL, of which case-based reasoning, or CBR, is a popular method), inductive logic programming (ILP), analytical learning (AL, of which explanation-based learning, or EBL is a method), combinedinductive and analytical learning (IAL), ensemble learning (EL) and support vector machines (SVM). The organization of different learning methods. In some literature [37, 1241, stochastic (statistical) learning
