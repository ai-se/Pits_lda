Download source code files, preprocessing steps. Used stemming and stopwords. Some naming conventions. They havent provided the data, we will have to do all these steps. 
k=500. LDA is once per system, but ours can take much larger time.
Unigrams and bigrams to build topics..

Using CDDT, LOC and other details they have answered the RQs. They dont have any baseline to work with.

They have acknowledged to the fact of parameter sensitivity in their results. They have varied different k, i to large values and checked.

SLR has different stages. Preparation/planning, retrieval and synthesis, reporting. Automation where machine learning mostly used is in the retrieval process.
Systematic literature review, less effort to change it to Automated literature review using topic modelling. So that we can have lesser effort in evaluating clinical trials.

Different classifers like SVM, Naive bayes, decision tress.
For data synthesis, people uses machine learning classifiers for document classification. Various search strings to search for specific papers.

uses lda to infer the latent topics in the sample documents and then used logistic regression to compute the probability that a given candidate criterion belongs to a particular topic.

 Studies Selection stage - ( PEx-Graph) The VTM (Visual text mining) tool can cluster related documents and label them with terms considered more significant to represent each cluster. PEx is used by these papers:
- Systematic literature reviews in software engineering â€“ a systematic literature review
- Procedures for performing systematic reviews
- A visual text mining approach for systematic reviews

 Studies Selection stage - ( ReVis) clusters and topics it applies clustering algorithms in order to create clusters and their respective topics;
- Guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in software engineering.
- Using mapping studies in software engineering
- A Visual Analysis Approach to Update Systematic Reviews

Exploring Topic Models in Software Engineering Data Analysis: A Survey
LDA is the most widely used topic model, followed by the relational topic model. Topic Modelling kept increasing during these years. See the survey graph. This shows how important it is becoming.
