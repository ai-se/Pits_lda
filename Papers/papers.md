## Source code retrieval for bug localization using latent dirichlet allocation - 2008, 131
http://www.unix.eng.ua.edu/~kw5639/PDFs/wcre.pdf
- analysis of 1,555 Java projects from SourceForge and Apache. Produced functional and easily interpretable topics.
- Toolkit - open-source software tool for LDA analysis called GibbsLDA++
- No validation done on the topics generated whether they are stable or not. Common parameters, k, a, b, no of iterations.
- K=100, α=0.05(50/K), and β=0.01

## Analysis of user comments: an approach for software requirements evolution - 2013, 61
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486865
- analysis of user comments. Results show that the automatically extracted topics match the manually extracted ones. Very solid statement.
- Stable levels are achieved for bigger values of k.
- Toolkit not mentioned, No validation done on the topics generated whether they are stable or not. No mention about Common parameters.
- Public data set of 3 mobile apps.

## A large scale study of programming languages and code quality in github
http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~filkov/papers/lang_github.pdf
- Data of Github
- Here they just try to find each project belonging to which different topics with its probabilities. (Kind of soft assignment)
- Toolkit not mentioned, No validation done on the topics generated whether they are stable or not. No mention about Common parameters.






## Non determininstic so not many people have bothered about how their results might vary.
